Subject: Azure Deployment Request - AI Multi-Agent System ($73/month)

Hi [Manager Name],

I need permission to deploy our AI Multi-Agent platform on Azure App Services for team collaboration. 

QUICK SUMMARY:
• Cost: $73/month (cheaper than alternatives)
• Security: Microsoft-managed platform with enterprise security
• Business Value: Team can collaborate on AI workflows instead of local-only access
• Technical: Requires 2 Azure resource providers to be registered

WHAT I NEED:
1. Azure resource provider registration for:
   - Microsoft.Web (App Services)
   - Microsoft.Insights (Monitoring)

2. Deployment permissions for existing "DigitalTwin" resource group

TECHNICAL DETAILS:
I've attached a detailed analysis document (MANAGER_REQUEST.md) covering:
✅ Cost breakdown and comparison
✅ Security and compliance considerations  
✅ Risk assessment and mitigation
✅ Implementation timeline
✅ Alternative options if full permissions not available

This is a standard Microsoft PaaS solution used by thousands of companies. The deployment can be completed in 2-4 hours once permissions are granted.

ALTERNATIVE: If immediate approval isn't possible, I can start with Azure Storage ($5/month) and upgrade later.

Please let me know if you need any additional information or have questions about the technical requirements.

Best regards,
Robert
